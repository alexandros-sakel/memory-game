## Project memory-game

This repo is for a memory game, developed for the Udacity Team. The theme of the game is based on the movie series cars. This game is realy fun to play especially for the little ones (the kids!!).    

## To Get Started

The project was build with html css and javascript. 

## Describing some features of the game

When the game starts you are going to hear an engine sound whith a little shaking effect.
As the game progresses and the player has made several moves! then the first trophy (Gold) is going to dissapear, the same is going to happen with the (silver).  

At the end of the game the player is going to be informed about he's progression.          
	* Which trophy did he get.  
	* What was he's score.  
	* How many minutes, seconds and moves did.  

Also at the end there is a steering wheel, if the player want's to play again he has to grab it!

## How to play 

The objective of this game is to:

1) Match all 16 cards in pairs of 2.        
    * The timer starts when the player chooses a card.   
  
2) The player must click on 2 cards. 
	* If the player finds 2 similar cards then the cards stay face up!
	* Else if the cards don't match then they move back to face down position.
